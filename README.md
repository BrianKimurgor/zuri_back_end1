# Backend Stage One Task

Welcome to the Backend Stage One Task project! This project aims to create and host an endpoint using Node.js that accepts two GET request query parameters and returns specific information in JSON format.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Node Package Manager

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backend-stage-one-task.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the project folder:

   ```shell
   cd backend-stage-one-task
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   ```

   You can change the `PORT` value to the desired port for your application.

5. Start the application:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

Your Node.js application should now be running.

## Project Structure
- `app.js`: The main application file.
- `routes/api.js`: Contains the API routes and logic.
- `controllers/apiController.js`: Handles API request processing.
- `middleware/errorHandler.js`: Custom error handling middleware.
- `.env.example`: Example environment variable configuration.

## Usage
To use the API, make GET requests to the endpoint with the following query parameters:

- `slack_name`: Your Slack name.
- `track`: Your chosen track (e.g., "backend").

Example API request:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api?slack_name=yourname&track=backend
```

## API Endpoint
The API endpoint returns a JSON response with the following structure:
```json
{
  "slack_name": "yourname",
  "current_day": "Monday",
  "utc_time": "2023-08-21T15:04:05Z",
  "track": "backend",
  "github_file_url": "https://github.com/yourusername/repo/blob/main/app.js",
  "github_repo_url": "https://github.com/yourusername/repo",
  "status_code": 200
}
```

## Testing
You can test the API using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl`. Ensure that the JSON response matches the specified format.

## Deployment
To deploy this application to a hosting service (e.g., Heroku), follow their deployment instructions and configure environment variables as needed.

## Built With
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Web framework for Node.js
